**How to Play**

Start the Game:
The game begins with an empty 3x3 grid.
Player 1 is assigned "X" and Player 2 is assigned "O".

Take Turns:
Players alternate placing their symbols ("X" or "O") by clicking on an empty cell in the grid.

Win or Draw:
The game automatically checks for a win or draw after each turn.
A player wins if they place three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.
