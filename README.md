# Tic-Tac-Toe Web Game

## Project Overview

The Tic-Tac-Toe Web Game is a simple and interactive web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. This project is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an engaging user experience. It supports two-player gameplay, allowing users to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid until a winner is determined.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface with a responsive grid layout.
- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against a friend in real-time.
- **Win Detection**: Automatic detection of winning conditions (row, column, diagonal).
- **Draw Handling**: Displays a message when the game ends in a tie.
- **Restart Option**: Ability to reset the game and start fresh.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game board.
- **CSS**: Styling for the layout and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, event handling, and win conditions.
